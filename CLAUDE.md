# Project Guidelines

## Matplotlib / Visualization
- **Never use Korean (한글) in chart titles, labels, legends, or annotations.** Korean text renders as broken characters (tofu) without extra font configuration. Always use English for all plot text.

## Language
- **Code comments (`#`) and markdown cells: Korean.** Only chart-rendered text must be English.
- Technical terms (e.g., logit, softmax, argmax) can remain in English within Korean sentences.
